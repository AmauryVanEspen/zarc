*     Step 1: get an instance of IF_ZARC_REMOTE_COMPARE based on the OBJTYPE parameter
      oref = cl_zarc_remote_compare=>factory( objtype = 'REPS' objname = 'RSHOWTIM' ).

*     Step 2: add the systems you want to use for version comparison (you can compare QAS and PRD even if you're runing it on DEV, yay!)
      oref->add_system_for_compare( 'DEV' ).
      oref->add_system_for_compare( 'QAS' ).

*     Step 3: execute the comparison, so that you can receive the true/false changeflag
      changed = oref->run_comparison( ).

      IF changed EQ abap_true.
        MESSAGE 'The object does contains changes.' TYPE 'I'.

    CATCH cx_zarc_objfac_exception INTO ex_ofe.
*     This exception is thrown when the Step 1 fails. It can happen when there's no CL_ZARC_REMOTE_COMPARE_XXXX definition to be instantiated, where XXXX equals OBJTYPE parameter.
    CATCH cx_zarc_compare_exception INTO ex_ce.
*     This exception is thrown when the Step 3 fails. This can happen when you try to run the comparison before add at least two systems on Step 2.
    CATCH cx_zarc_notimplemented_ex INTO ex_nie.
*     This exception is thrown when the Step 3 fails. It means that something inside ZARC isn't quite ready yet. But the good news is that you can help us! :)
  ENDTRY.
